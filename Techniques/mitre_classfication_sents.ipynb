       "[\"All observed attacks start with an email message, containing either a malicious attachment or a URL which leads to the first stage of the attack. The text of the emails is likely taken from legitimate email, such as mailing lists that targeted organizations may be subscribed to. Below are three examples, with the first one purporting to be sent by the European Banking Federation and is using a newly registered domain for the spoofed sender email address. The attachment is a malicious PDF file that entices the user to click on a URL to download and open a weaponized RTF file containing exploits for CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2017-8570 and CVE-2018-8174. The final payload is a JScript backdoor also known as More_eggs that allows the attacker to control the affected system remotely.\\nNotable applications used in these attacks are cmstp and msxsl. The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (cmstp.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles. Cmstp accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter and installs a service profile leveraged for remote access connections. A malicious INF file can be supplied as a parameter to download and execute remote code. Cmstp may also be used to load and execute COM scriptlets (SCT files) from remote servers.\\nMicrosoft allows developers to create COM+ objects in script code stored in an XML document, a so-called scriptlet file. Although it is common to use JScript or VBScript, as they are available in Windows by default, a scriptlet can contain COM+ objects implemented in other languages, including Perl and Python, which would be fully functional if the respective interpreters are installed.\\nTo bypass AppLocker and launching script code within a scriptlet, the attacker includes the malicious code within an XML script tag placed within the registration tag of the scriptlet file and calls cmstp with appropriate parameters.\\nAn earlier part of the second stage is implemented as an encrypted JScript scriptlet which eventually drops a randomly named COM server DLL binary with a .txt filename extension, for example, 9242.txt, in the user's home folder and registers the server using the regsvr32.exe utility.The dropper contains an encrypted data blob that is decrypted and written to the disk. The dropper then launches the next stage of the attack by starting PowerShell, msxsl or cmstp.exe as described above.\\nThe PowerShell chain is launched from an obfuscated JScript scriptlet previously downloaded from the command and control (C2) server and launched using cmstp.exe. The first PowerShell stage is a simple downloader that downloads the next PowerShell stage and launches a child instance of powershell.exe using the downloaded, randomly named script as the argument. The downloaded PowerShell script code is obfuscated in several layers before the last layer is reached. The last layer loads shellcode into memory and creates a thread within the PowerShell interpreter process space.\\nOn the PowerShell side of the infection chain, the downloaded final payload is a Cobalt Strike beacon, which provides the attacker with rich backdoor functionality.\",\n",
       " 'Benign activity ran for most of the morning while the tools were being setup for the day.

The attacker tried to elevate using a few different drivers, but it failed once again due to the computer having been restarted without disabling driver signature enforcement.

This triggered the Firefox backdoor to connect out via DNS to XX--ls8h.com.  Drakon APT was downloaded and executed and connected to 128.55.12.167:8640 for C2.

       " 'The threat actors sent the trojanized Microsoft Word documents, probably via email. Talos discovered a document named  MinutesofMeeting-2May19.docx. Once the victim opens the document, it fetches a remove template from the actor-controlled website, hxxp://droobox[.]online:80/luncher.doc. Once the luncher.doc was downloaded, it used CVE-2017-11882, to execute code on the victim\\'s machine. After the exploit, the file would write a series of base64-encoded PowerShell commands that acted as a stager and set up persistence by adding it to the HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run Registry key.\\nOnce the evasion checks were complete, the threat actors used MSbuild to execute an actor-created file named \"LOCALAPPDATA\\\\Intel\\\\instal.xml\". Based on lexical analysis, we assess with high confidence that this component of the macro script was based on an open-source project called \"MSBuild-inline-task.\" While this technique was previously documented last year, it has rarely been observed being used in operations. Talos suspects the adversary chose MSBuild because it is a signed Microsoft binary, meaning that it can bypass application whitelisting controls on the host when being used to execute arbitrary code.\\nOnce the \"instal.xml\" file began execution, it would deobfuscate the base64-encoded commands. This revealed a stager, or a small script designed to obtain an additional payload. While analyzing this stager, we noticed some similarities to the \"Get-Data\" function of the FruityC2 PowerShell agent. One notable difference is that this particular stager included functionality that allowed the stager to communicate with the command and control (C2) via an encrypted RC4 byte stream. In this sample, the threat actors\\' C2 server was the domain msdn[.]cloud.\\nthe C2 would return a string of characters. Once the string was RC4 decrypted, it launched a PowerShell Empire agent.

       " 'Here is the email content, masquerading as an airline ticket confirmation, which asks the targeted victim to click on a link. It was designed so that a victim downloads a 7z file from the link shown in figure 1 that contains this new variant of HawkEye and runs it on the victim’s system. Unfortunately, on initial analysis the URL was not available and I received a “404 Not Found” message in the browser. Browsing to its main page. It turned out to be an FTP service, containing several related network folders about this campaign, with most containing the same malware sample (Figure 2). After the downloaded 7z file was decompressed, we retrieved the EXE file “TICKET%2083992883992AIR8389494VERVED37783PDF.exe”, which is the new variant of HawkEye. Once HawkEye started, it spawned a suspended child process, “RegAsm.exe”, from the Microsoft .Net framework installation directory – which is a tool for Assembly Registration. Meanwhile, HawkEye extracted a PE file into its memory and then moved the PE file into “RegAsm.exe”. The dynamically extracted PE file is the main program of HawkEye. It’s called “HawkEye_RegAsm,” to differentiate these files in the analysis. HawkEye_RegAsm began running after resuming running “RegAsm.exe” after being suspended.HawkEye_RegAsm is a .Net written program, which is packed by ConfuserEx v1.0.0 to protect itself. HawkEye_RegAsm starts a thread to perform the above tasks, and then every 10 minutes it sends its collected information to its Yandex email address. HawkEye_RegAsm sets up a clipboard and keyboard logger using Windows-native APIs (such as SetWindowsHookEx, SetClipboardViewer, etc.) Its local functions can record victim’s behaviors when the victim types on the keyboard as well as when copying data into the system clipboard. Figure 4 shows an example of the information that HawkEye_RegAsm collected from its keyboard and clipboard logger, as well as the software title from when the event occurred. HawkEye_RegAsm performs a similar task as to the RegAsm.exe. It spawns two suspended child processes, “vbc.exe”, which are from the same directory as RegAsm.exe. HawkEye dynamically extracts two PE files into its memory, which are then copied into the two newly created child processes of “vbc.exe”. It also modifies its ThreadContext data (It calls the API, SetThreadContext) and makes its entry point to the transfered PE file. When “vbc.exe” resumes running it can be executed. It’s a trick that malware often performs to camouflage itself behind of a normal process. The two “vbc.exe” processes collect credentials from the victim’s system. One is used to collect the credentials of browsers. The other one focuses on email clients and IM clients to steal credentials and profiles. Both PE files injected into “vbc.exe” have the same code framework. They first call a function to collect credentials and save them in memory, and second, it reads the collected data, formats it, and saves it to a tmp file from its command line parameter. Figure 5 shows HawkEye calling the CreateProcess API to start one of the two “vbc.exe” processes, with the parameter shown below in the “Locals” sub-tab. You can see the full path of “vbc.exe”. “/stext \"\"C:\\\\Users\\\\*********\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\tmpBE3D.tmp\"\"\" is the parameter passed to it. The tmp file name is random and different from the two “vbc.exe” processes, which temporarily saves collected credentials. The two PE files are not packer protected and not .Net written program. The first “vbs.exe” collects credentials from victim’s browsers and the system credential manager for IE. In my analysis, this variant of HawkEye focuses on the following browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Opera, Mozilla Sunbird, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Portable Thunderbird, Mozilla SeaMonkey, YandexBrowser, Vivaldi browser, and more. Figure 6 shows some strings defined in the ASM code of the browsers that the HawkEye malware wants to collect credentials from. The collected credentials are then saved into the tmp file from its command line parameter. HawkEye_RegAsm keeps checking this tmp file, and once the credentials are collected, it is done. HawkEye_RegAsm then reads the entire data of this tmp file into its memory and the deletes it immediately. The second PE file in “vbc.exe”collects profile and credential information of the email and IM software client installed on a victim’s machine. The clients it targets are: Qualcomm Eudora, Mozilla Thunderbird, MS Office Outlook, IncrediMail, Groupmail, MSNMessenger, Yahoo!Pager/Yahoo!Messenger and Windows Mail. Below is an example list that HawkEye stole from the Chrome browser on my test machine. As you can see, it includes login URL, Browser name, User name, Password, Created time, and the full path of the file where the collected information came from. The second PE file in “vbc.exe” not only collects the client’s login username and password, but also profile information, such as the recipent Server address, recipient Server Port, protocol Type (POP3), SMTP Server, SMTP Port, etc. Figure 7 shows a screenshot of Ollydbg when “vbc.exe” was about to write the collected recipient Server addresses into its tmp file. It writes one line once. The same tmp file is finally read by HawkEye_RegAsm and then deleted. Ok. Now let’s go back to the main process of HawkEye_RegAsm, which controls all tasks of HawkEye and sends the victim’s credentials. In its main program, it calls Thread.Sleep(600000), and pauses while collecting credentials every 10 minutes. That is, it reports the collected data to attacker the once every 10 minutes. It first sends an HTTP request, http://bot.whatismyipaddress.com, to ask for my machine’s public IP. This is a way to ensure that the victim’s machine is able to access the internet. If it did not reply with a public IP, it stops sending collected data to the email box. In addition, the IP appears in the email subject so it can identify victims. The attacker’s email is in Yandex.mail, whose email account and password are used when sending collected data through the Yandex SMTP server.',\n",
       " 'The attackers would usually send a malicious email message that either links to an archive file (RAR or ZIP compressed) or has one attached to it. Below are malicious email messages that have been sent to multiple targets on September and December 2015. If the victim extracts the archive and clicks the .exe file, the lure document or video are presented while the computer is being infected with DustySky. In recent samples the group used Microsoft Word files embed with a malicious macro, which would infect the victim if enabled. Note, that these infection methods rely on social engineering - convincing the victim to open the file (and enabling content if it is disabled) - and not on software vulnerabilities. The subject line of the malicious email message, as well as the name and content of the lure document, are usually related to recent events in diplomacy, defense, and politics. Sometimes lure topics are gossip or sex related and might even include a pornographic video. In recent samples, fake invoices and a copy of the public Google privacy policy were used. The content of the lure document is always copied from a public news item or other web content, and is never an original composition of the attackers. When linked from the malicious message, the malware would be hosted either on a cloud service (many times in copy.com, a legitimate file hosting service), or on a server controlled by the attackers.

Upon execution of the malicious version (2f452e90c2f9b914543847ba2b431b9a) the legitimate iMazing is installed, while in the background DustySky is dropped as a file named Plugin.exe (1d9612a869ad929bd4dd16131ddb133a), and executed.

The macro contains a slightly obfuscated malicious executable file inside. The executable data is stored inside the macro in the form of arrays with integer values spread throughout the macro script. The data from the arrays is combined and written to disk in the Application Data folder. The filename chosen seems to be random for every macro—most likely generated automatically. In the XLS shown above, the PE is written to %appdata%rqco.exe and executed. This file is a small (3kb) loader, which downloads the second stage of the attack. The loader has no imports, but at runtime, resolves the UrlDownloadToFile function from the URLMON library to download stage two, and then ShellExecute from kernel32 to run the downloaded stage two. The stage-two payload downloads from hxxp://unifscon[.]com/R9_Sys.exe. The C2 server configured for the attack on the defense contractor is civita2.no-ip.biz. Then, a little while after sending out the spear phishing emails, we can see the IP resolution change with, most likely, IP addresses of compromised machines used for SOCKS5 proxying to hide the C2.',\n",
       " 'On February 11, FireEye identified a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-0322)  being served up from the U.S. Veterans of Foreign Wars’ website (vfw[.]org). After compromising the VFW website, the attackers added an iframe into the beginning of the website’s HTML code that loads the attacker’s page in the background. The attacker’s HTML/JavaScript page runs a Flash object, which orchestrates the remainder of the exploit. The exploit includes calling back to the IE 10 vulnerability trigger, which is embedded in the JavaScript.  Specifically, visitors to the VFW website were silently redirected through an iframe to the exploit at www.[REDACTED].com/Data/img/img.html. The attacker uses the Microsoft.XMLDOM ActiveX control to load a one-line XML string containing a file path to the EMET DLL. Then the exploit code parses the error resulting from the XML load order to determine whether the load failed because the EMET DLL is not present.  The exploit proceeds only if this check determines that the EMET DLL is not present. Once the attacker’s code has full memory access through the corrupted Flash Vector object, the code searches through loaded libraries gadgets by machine code. The attacker then overwrites the vftable pointer of a flash.Media.Sound() object in memory to point to the pivot and begin ROP. After successful exploitation, the code repairs the corrupted Flash Vector and flash.Media.Sound to continue execution. Subsequently, the malicious Flash code downloads a file containing the dropped malware payload. The beginning of the file is a JPG image; the end of the file (offset 36321) is the payload, encoded with an XOR key of 0x95. The attacker appends the payload to the shellcode before pivoting to code control. Then, when the shellcode is executed, the malware creates files “sqlrenew.txt” and “stream.exe”. The tail of the image file is decoded, and written to these files. “sqlrenew.txt” is then executed with the LoadLibraryA Windows API call. As documented above, this exploit dropped an XOR (0x95) payload that executed a ZxShell backdoor (MD5: 8455bbb9a210ce603a1b646b0d951bce). The ZxShell backdoor is a widely used and publicly available tool used by multiple threat actors linked to cyber espionage operations. This particular variant called back to a command and control server located at newss[.]effers[.]com. This domain currently resolves to 118.99.60.142.
