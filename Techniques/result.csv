"Written in Go, it is flexible enough to generate binaries compatible with various architectures",T1027
NKAbuse infiltrates systems by uploading an implant to the victim host,T1105
"Its capabilities span flooding to backdoor access to remote administration (RAT), offering a range of features",T1021
Evidence collected and analyzed by GERT suggests that this attack exploited an old vulnerability related to Struts2 (CVE-2017-5638 – Apache Struts2), targeting a financial company",T1203
The vulnerability allows the attackers to execute commands on the server by passing the command in a header identified as “shell” and sending the instructions to Bash for execution,T1059
"After the vulnerability is exploited, a command is executed on the system to download the initial script",T1105
The malware is typically installed on the victim’s device by executing a remote shell script that downloads and executes the contents of the setup",T1059
"The setup process checks the OS type and, depending on that, it downloads the second stage, which is the actual malware implant",T1082
"The implant is downloaded from the same server; it is named “app_linux_{ARCH}”, where “{ARCH}” is the target OS architecture",T1036
Then the implant retrieves the infected machine’s IP address by sending a GET request to ifconfig,T1016
NKAbuse makes use of cron jobs to survive reboots,T1053
NKAbuse utilizes the NKN protocol to communicate with the bot master and receive/send information",T1071
"In fact, most of the message commands mentioned above are, in one way or another, used for persistence, command execution, or information gathering",T1059
"It contains a number of other structures that store information about the infected host: the PID, the victim’s IP address, free memory, current configuration, and so on",T1016
Another feature of this malware is the ability to make screenshots of the infected machine,T1113
"It uses an open-source project to determine the display bounds and then capture an image of the current screen, in order to convert it to PNG and send to the bot master",T1113
"NKAbuse can also create files with specific content, remove files from the file system, and fetch a file list from a specific path",T1083
It can get a list of processes running in the system and even a detailed list of the available network interfaces,T1057
