Not allowing unsigned applications from being run may also mitigate some risk. Applications with known vulnerabilities or known shell escapes should not have the setuid or setgid bits set to reduce potential damage if an application is compromised.

The sudoers file should be strictly edited such that passwords are always required and that users can't spawn risky processes as users with higher privilege.
