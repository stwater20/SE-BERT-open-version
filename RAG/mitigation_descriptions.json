Other types of virtualization and application microsegmentation may also mitigate the impact of some types of exploitation. Risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in these systems may still exist. [42]",
        "Security applications that look for behavior used during exploitation such as Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG) and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to mitigate some exploitation behavior. [43] Control flow integrity checking is another way to potentially identify and stop a software exploit from occurring. [44] Many of these protections depend on the architecture and target application binary for compatibility and may not work for all software or services targeted.",
